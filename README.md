I've worked as both an iOS and web dev. Here's just a sampling of my code.

## Example iOS App with localization

- Little e-reader with vocab assistence for language learners
- This project demonstrates how namespacing can help keep strings clean within large projects. Also shows basic feature adaption for RTL v LTR languages
