# Hi, and welcome to my portfolio!
I'm an iOS dev with mostly experience with Swift exploring SwiftUI. I plan to post some of my projects here.

## Example iOS App with localization
- [GremGramReader](https://github.com/wondachue/GremGramReader)
- Little e-reader with vocab assistence for language learners
- This project demonstrates how namespacing can help keep strings clean within large projects. Also shows basic feature adaption for RTL v LTR languages
